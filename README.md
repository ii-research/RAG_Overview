# RAG_Overview

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) by curating highly related resources, including representative papers, workshops, tutorials, evaluation tracts and open-source projects.
Given the rapid evolution of this field, we will continue to update the repository on a regular basis.
